# Calendar-Puzzle
Python code to solve the calendar puzzle for any day of the year

## Background
The "Calendar Puzzle" is a puzzle that has many different solutions for each day of the year.
It consists of 10 puzzle pieces that can be placed so that the month, day, and day of the week are visible when all the pieces fit in the playing space

## Solution
- To get a solution, call the function "create_board", using the inputs (base_board, Month, Day, Weekday). See the data dictionary for how to type in the month and weekday.
- Then, call "visualize board" on the board you just created
- Note: The code takes a several minutes to run. The duration can also change depending on the day, so be patient while you wait for results. If there are any ideas on potential speed-ups (maybe incorporating machine learning), please reach out.
